# WP Bitly - Limit Bit links

This is an extension of the original plugin that addresses the issue for long-running blogs where too many bitlinks get created by visitors and you run up against Bitly's link-creation threshold.

By adding a new setting for WP-Bitly that restricts bitlinks to only those posts within a certain number of days, we cut off visitors to old, out dated posts.
